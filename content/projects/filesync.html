File syncronization with python

{%- endmark %}


A file syncronization software written in Python. Can tansmit files to a server, and transmit it back to other clients. May damage your files, if the connection is broken while syncronizing, so it's not save to use it in production environments. Was more of a project for me to learn python, if there is any interest, fork the project on GitHub.
