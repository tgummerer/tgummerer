Performance Analysis on Android.

{%- endmark %}
 

The task for this university project was to develop an app for Android, which can measure the performance difference between Java and C/C++. It can also show and monitor the memory usage of all the apps running on the device. All the graphs within the app are displayed using OpenGL ES. The data is stored in a SQLite database and can be exported as a csv file to the SD Card.

The app reveals that C/C++ can have a performance advantage of ~10% to ~80% for more complex problems. However the cases in which this performance advantage pays of in terms of user experience compared to the development time are very rare. It makes only sense to use it for some complex games and apps that use OpenGL.
